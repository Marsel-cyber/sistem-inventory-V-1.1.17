There appears to be a syntax error in the code where some content is duplicated and misplaced. Here's the corrected version of that section:

```typescript
<TableCell>
  <div className="text-sm">
    <p>{product.packaging}</p>
    <p className="text-gray-500">{product.size}</p>
  </div>
</TableCell>
```

The erroneous section that included the duplicate rounding logic:
```typescript
{formData.rounding_enabled ? (
  <>â†’ {formatCurrency(customRound(areaPrice.price))}</>
) : (
  <>Tanpa pembulatan: {formatCurrency(areaPrice.price)}</>
)}
```

should be removed as it was incorrectly placed inside the packaging/size table cell.

This fixes the syntax error while maintaining the intended functionality of displaying the product's packaging and size information in the table cell.

The rest of the code appears to be syntactically correct and can remain unchanged.
